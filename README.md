# Programming language trends on google (2014-2017) | Data Sciences Project

Here is a data plotting of the google trends of 4 programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C++ and SQL) from 2014 to 2017.

I've use python language to write the code and I've use the numpy and matplotlib library.

The program give you an overview of which one of the languages should have an higher demand in the futur 
with a linear regression and the minimum value and maximum value over this period of time.
